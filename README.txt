flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=[port#]

api: https://www.coinbase.com/
second api: https://www.coinmarketcap.com

example crypto's
    btc : for bitcoin
    eth : for etheruem
    ltc : for litecoin
    ...

TO USE: Theres a searchable drop down, which you can choose a crypto from and you can see the Spot, Buy, and Sell price of the crypto.
    So I added a second api to get more information, I made a call to it and get back a ton of data, I display the data in a table on my webpage.
    The data returned is information about crypto currencies, you can return anywhere from 1-2000 that will go in a table format
